    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Morphological segmentation is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves breaking down words into their smallest meaning-bearing units called morphemes. This process is particularly important for morphologically rich languages like Telugu, where words are often formed by combining root words with multiple affixes. For example, the Telugu word \"‡∞ö‡∞¶‡±Å‡∞µ‡±Å‡∞§‡±Å‡∞®‡±ç‡∞®‡∞æ‡∞®‡±Å\" can be segmented into \"‡∞ö‡∞¶‡±Å‡∞µ‡±Å\" (read) + \"‡∞§‡±Å‡∞®‡±ç‡∞®‡∞æ‡∞®‡±Å\" (I am), representing both the action and the subject in a single word. Given the complexity and variability of Telugu morphology, traditional supervised approaches that require large annotated datasets are impractical.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we use Morfessor, an unsupervised segmentation tool that learns to split words based on recurring patterns and statistical structure. This makes it well-suited for low-resource languages like Telugu. The goal of this project is to train the Morfessor model on a carefully curated mix of synthetic and real-world Telugu words, evaluate its segmentation performance on a 500-word gold-standard test set, and explore ways to improve segmentation accuracy using corpus balancing and optional semi-supervision.\n"

    "# üìù Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explored unsupervised morphological segmentation of Telugu using the Morfessor model. We trained the model on a carefully constructed 2,000-word balanced corpus containing both real and synthetically generated Telugu words, and evaluated it on a manually annotated 500-word gold-standard dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model achieved a strong accuracy of 90%, correctly segmenting 450 out of 500 words. Additionally, it was able to segment 459 out of 500 words into multiple morphemes, demonstrating its ability to generalize well to unseen word forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We observed that the model performed best on words with clear and frequent suffixes such as \"‡∞≤‡±ã\", \"‡∞≤‡∞ï‡∞ø\", and \"‡∞§‡∞æ‡∞°‡±Å\". It occasionally struggled with long or irregular compound words and tense formations, which could potentially be addressed through semi-supervised training and post-processing rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project showed that combining a moderate amount of real data with targeted synthetic examples can result in highly effective unsupervised segmentation ‚Äî especially valuable in low-resource language settings like Telugu.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introduce semi-supervised training using a small gold-segmented dictionary\n",
    "- Train on real-world corpora (e.g., Telugu Wikipedia or news datasets)\n",
    "- Apply rule-based post-processing for complex suffixes\n",
    "- Explore integrating part-of-speech information or language modeling features\n",
    "\n",
    "With these improvements, the Morfessor-based segmentation system could support downstream tasks such as machine translation, spell-checking, or educational language tools for Telugu.\n"
