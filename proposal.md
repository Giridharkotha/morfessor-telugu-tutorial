# ðŸ“˜ Project Proposal: Morphological Segmentation with Morfessor for Telugu

## ðŸ”§ Tool/Process Being Explored

This tutorial explores **unsupervised morphological segmentation** using the **Morfessor** model, specifically applied to **Telugu**, a morphologically rich and agglutinative language. Morfessor learns how to split words into morphemes (smallest meaning-bearing units) without requiring labeled training data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Create an accessible, step-by-step tutorial in a **Jupyter Notebook** that demonstrates:
- Preprocessing and preparing Telugu text
- Training Morfessor on this data
- Predicting and visualizing segmented outputs
- Evaluating segmentation quality with a manually annotated set

## ðŸ“‚ Repository

GitHub Link:  
ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/Giridharkotha/morfessor-telugu-tutorial

The repository will include:
- Jupyter notebook tutorial (`morfessor_tutorial.ipynb`)
- Conda environment file (`environment.yml`) for reproducibility
- Data folder with raw and annotated Telugu data
- Results and visualizations

## ðŸ“Š Dataset & Evaluation

Morfessor does not need labeled data to train. However, to evaluate the model's segmentation quality, I will:
- Use a small manually annotated list of segmented Telugu words  
**OR**
- Attempt to find existing annotated data from Telugu WordNet or linguistic datasets.

## ðŸ§  Why This Project?

Telugu is an underrepresented language in NLP. This project allows me to explore **low-resource language modeling**, and contribute an educational resource others can learn from. It is also personally meaningful due to my interest in linguistic structure and unsupervised learning approaches.

## âœ… Deliverables

- A well-organized Jupyter Notebook tutorial
- Conda environment file (`environment.yml`)
- Annotated and unannotated Telugu data
- Evaluation results and discussion
